# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I  have several of unfinished projects (UFOs), some knitting, some sewing, some painting, etc.  I have several friends,
that like me have boxes of UFOs and have trouble keeping track of the status of all them. 
I want to create an app that allows fellow hobbyists to document and track their ongoing projects, view their
 progress on their UFOs using a visual project tracker and browse other ongoing projects being made by other hobbyists.
 
### Features
1)User login/log out/Sign-up:  
Users must sign-up for an account and then can login & log out of their account.  Only users with an account can create 
a project post or search for other projects. Each user will have a home page that will display their list of projects 
with their corresponding title picture and visual project completion tracker.
The default listing will have the projects grouped by finished versus unfinished projects and the unfinished project 
with the oldest start will be displayed first.

2)Create a New Project Page:  
From their homepage, the user will click on a link that will redirect them to a form to create a new project. 
Each project will have a project home page which will contain a title an optional description, main project picture 
and a project start date.
After the project is created, the user may add project steps or additional pages to their projects which can include 
text or pictures of the progress made on the project.  After a new projects step is posted, the user will be promoted to
optionally update their progress tracker. All project pages will be editable.

3)Visual Project Progress Tracker:  
The tracker will be a slider that displays progress completion as a loading bar type box and as a percentage. 
This tracker will be displayed on the the user homepage next the project title/ picture and will be displayed on the 
individual project page.

4)View Posts of Other Users:  
The user can search for projects by other users by post date or level of completion.
